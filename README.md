# Car Price Prediction ML Pipeline 🚗📊

End-to-end machine learning pipeline for car price prediction, featuring EDA, feature engineering, model tuning, and deployment-ready Random Forest.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a robust ML workflow to predict car prices based on features such as company, fuel type, kilometers driven, and car age.  
It demonstrates:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering (log-transform, car age, kms/year)
- Preprocessing pipelines (scaling, encoding, power transform)
- Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Model persistence with `pickle` for deployment
